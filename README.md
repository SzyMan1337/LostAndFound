# LostAndFound 


This repository contains the source code for an engineering thesis project completed in 2023. It introduces the LostAndFound system, a dedicated service for posting and discovering lost or found items. The primary goal of LostAndFound is to facilitate the process of reuniting lost belongings with their owners. By gathering advertisements about lost or found properties, the service serves as a mediator in the recovery process. It provides users with the convenience of accessing these functionalities through both a mobile application and a web application, ensuring a broad reach for potential users to reclaim their lost items.

LostAndFound stands out by offering a comprehensive approach to tackling the challenge of lost items. It not only provides a platform for posting and searching for lost or found items but also includes detailed instructions on how to use the system effectively. Users can benefit from a well-structured system that simplifies the process of finding lost belongings or reporting found items.

The system architecture is designed with two main layers in mind: the client application layer and the backend layer, characterized by a microservices structure. This design ensures scalability and flexibility, accommodating a wide range of functionalities and making it easier for users to navigate through the service.

The project emphasizes user experience, offering two client applications: a web app for browser use and a mobile app for Android devices. This dual approach ensures that users can access the service from their preferred devices, enhancing the chances of lost items being reported and found.
